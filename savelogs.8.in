.SH NAME
savelogs \- rotate logs
.SH SYNOPSIS
savelogs
.RI [ -dfv ]
.RI [ -V ]
.RI [ -C " config-file]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B savelogs
program rotates logs, optionally saving the old ones elsewhere and
signalling the programs that created the logfiles.

.SH THE CONFIGURATION FILE
.I /etc/savelogs.conf
tells
.B savelogs
which logs to rotate, when to rotate them, whether to back them up,
and what to do after a log is rotated.   The format of the configuration
file is a
.BR filename ,
followed by a list of commands, with punctuation and case ignored.
.TP
.BI EVERY " DAY|WEEK|YEAR"
Rotate the log at this time.  If you tell it 
.BR WEEK " (" YEAR "),"
the rotation will happen on a sunday 
(the last sunday of the year).  
.TP
.BI SAVE " n " IN " directory"
Save
.I n
old logs in the named directory as
.BI o. log\fR.
Previously existing
files will be renamed to
.BI o file
to accomodate the new file (so the old
.I o.log
becomes 
.IR oo.log ,
and so on), up to the number 
of files you want to save.
.TP
.BI TOUCH " mode"
After rotating the old log, create a new (empty) log with the given
.IR mode .
.TP
.BI SIZE " size"
Rotate the log if it gets larger than this size.  If you suffix the
size with 
.BR K ,
the size is in kilobytes, and a
.B M
suffix means megabytes.
.TP
.BI SIGNAL " action"
After rotating a log and 
.BR TOUCH ing
it, run this command.
.B savelogs
attempts to batch 
.BR SIGNAL ,
so that if multiple logs are rotated the actions will only be executed
once.
.PP
For example, the following configuration file

.nf
/var/adm/syslog EVERY WEEK
                SAVE 2 IN /var/adm/OLD
                TOUCH 644
                SIGNAL "killall -HUP syslogd"
.fi

.PP
Rotates
.I /var/adm/syslog
every sunday, creating a new empty file with mode 644, saving two of the
old logs in
.IR /var/adm/OLD ,
and sending a 
.B HUP
signal to
.I syslogd
after it's finished.
