.Nm savelogs
.Nd rotate logfiles
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl dfv
.Op Fl V
.Op Fl C Pa config-file
.Op class
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program rotates logs, optionally saving the old ones elsewhere and
signalling the programs that created the logfiles.

.Sh THE CONFIGURATION FILE
.Pa /etc/savelogs.conf
tells
.Nm
which logs to rotate, when to rotate them, whether to back them up,
and what to do after a log is rotated.  The configuration file
also allows you to configure how backup files are named and whether
they are compressed.
.Pp
A file description is
file is a
.Pa filename ,
followed by a list of commands, with punctuation and case ignored.
.Bl -tag -width "THIS IS A TEST OK"
.It EVERY Bq DAY|WEEK|MONTH|YEAR
Rotate the log at this time.
.It SAVE Ar n IN Pa directory
Save
.Ar n
old logs in the named directory.
Previously existing files will be renamed to
accomodate the new file up to the number 
of files you want to save.   Backup file names are the filename
prefixed with a number counting from zero up.
.It TOUCH Ar mode
After rotating the old log, create a new (empty) log with the given
.Ar mode .
.It SIZE Ar size
Rotate the log if it gets larger than this size.  If you suffix the
size with 
.Ar K ,
the size is in kilobytes, and a
.Ar M
suffix means megabytes.
.It CLASS Dq class
This file is backed up in
.Ar class .
.It SIGNAL Dq action
After rotating a log and 
.Ar TOUCH Ns No ing
it, run this command.
.Nm
attempts to batch 
.Ar SIGNAL Ns No s ,
so that if multiple logs are rotated the actions will only be executed
once.
.Pp
For example, the following configuration file
.Pp
.nf
    /var/adm/syslog EVERY WEEK
		    SAVE 2 IN /var/adm/OLD
		    TOUCH 644
		    SIGNAL "killall -HUP syslogd"
.fi
.Pp
Rotates
.Pa /var/adm/syslog
every week, creating a new empty file with mode 644, saving two of the
old logs in
.Pa /var/adm/OLD ,
and sending a 
.Ar HUP
signal to
.Xr syslogd 1
after it's finished.
.El
.Pp
You can also specify backup naming and compression on a logfile by
logfile basis by using options listed for the 
.Em SET
directive (see below.)
If you don't set the backup naming and compression for a logfile, it
takes the settings that were defined before it, so
.Pp
.nf
    SET COMPRESSED
    /var/log/messages SAVE 2 IN /var/log/OLD
    SET UNCOMPRESSED
    /var/log/syslog SAVE 2 IN /var/log/OLD
.fi
.Pp
Means that
.Pa /var/log/messages
will be saved as a compressed file, while
.Pa /var/log/syslog
will be saved uncompressed.
.Pp
To configure how backups are named and whether they are compressed,
use the
.Em SET Ar option
command.   The following options are defined:
.Bl -tag -width uncompressed
.It Ar dots
Instead of using a revision number, prefix each backup file with
.Dq o 's,
where the older ones have more dots than the newer ones do.
.It Ar numbers
Use a revision number on the backup files.
.It Ar suffix
Put the revision # (or 
.Ar dots )
at the end of the filename.
.It Ar prefix
Put the revision # (or
.Ar dots )
at the start of the filename.
.It Ar compressed
Compress the backup files with
.Pa @COMPRESS@ .
.It Ar uncompressed
Don't compress the backup files.
.El
.Sh COMMAND-LINE OPTIONS
.Bl -tag -width XXX
.It Fl V
Print version information, then exit.
.It Fl d
Print debugging information.  More 
.Ar d
flags make
.Nm
generate more debugging.
.It Fl f
Rotate all logs, no matter what.
.It Fl C Pa config-file
Use the named
.Pa config-file
instead of the default
.Pq /etc/savelogs.conf .
